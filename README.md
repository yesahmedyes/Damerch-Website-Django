# damerch-website

I created this full fledged ecommerce platform with authentication, social logins, user alerts, cart, checkout, automatic email sending and payment method e.t.c.

The technologies that were used in this project are mainly Django for the backend, Sqlite3 for database and JQuery, Ajax and Bootstrap for the frontend
